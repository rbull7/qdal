# Research context {#sec-res-context}

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Area-Research_methods-blue)

@fig-res-process shows the main steps that compose the research process. The first component is the [research context]{.smallcaps}. @ellis2008 discuss the research context and propose a convenient break-down of the concept. @fig-res-context is a schematic representation of different aspects of the research context, from the most general to the most specific. An example of each is also provided.

The following sections treat research questions and research hypotheses in more detail.

## Research questions

Research questions are **questions** whose answers directly address the research problem. They take the form of actual *questions*. For example:

-   What is the average speech rate of adolescents vs that of older adults?
-   What happens to infants' syntactic processing when they move from a monolingual to a multilingual environment?
-   Is the morphological complexity of languages spoken by larger populations different from that of languages spoken by smaller populations?

Research questions are always necessary, independent of the type and objective of the research. While there is an undue pressure on researcher to come up with "novel" research questions all the time, it is perfectly fine to ask the same question multiple times.

## Research hypotheses

Research questions can be further developed into **research hypotheses**. Research hypotheses are **statements** (not questions) about the research problem. Hypotheses **are never true nor confirmed**. We can only **corroborate** hypothesis, and it's a long term process. The same hypothesis has to be tested again and again, by multiple researchers in multiple contexts. Research is not a one-off matter: knowledge can only be acquired slowly and with a lot of effort. This idea has been beautifully synthesised into the "Slow Science" movement [@slowscienceacademy2010]: "\[Researchers\] need time to think. \[Researchers\] need time to read, and time to fail. \[Researchers\] do not always know what it might be at right now."

It is however perfectly fine to run a study with only research questions, without a research hypothesis. As long as you clearly state whether you are talking about research *questions* or research *hypotheses* and you don't mix them up, you are fine.

## Precision and testability

Solid research questions and hypotheses must have two main properties: they must be **precise and testable**. Precision is about the semantics of the words and phrases that make up the question or hypothesis. For example, in the question "Is the morphological complexity of languages spoken by larger populations different from that of languages spoken by smaller populations?" we need to clearly define the following: morphological complexity, larger population, smaller population. What do we mean by "morphological complexity"? How do we classify a population as large or small? For our research question to be a good research question, it is important that we think very hard about what we mean by those words. This is because depending on the specific meaning, we might obtain different outcomes, and to be sure that the outcomes answer our specific research question we need to ensure that the question itself and the words within it are well defined.

Secondly, research questions and hypotheses must be testable. *Testability* is about formulating research questions and hypotheses in a manner that is precise enough that it naturally leads to a well-defined, specific study design. For example, the testability of the hypothesis from @fig-res-context would be compromised if we didn't define "processing cost" precisely. For example, processing cost could be related to the cognitive load of processing the sentences, or to the number of "computational steps" needed to process the sentence, or to the ease of the computational steps independent of their number. All of these aspects are strictly entangled with the researcher's assumptions and favourite linguistic framework or model of sentence processing. Very often, "fast research" leads to hypotheses that look precise and testable on the surface, but they fail to hit the mark upon greater scrutiny. Lack of precision and testability undermines the robustness of research, as pointed out for example by @yarkoni2022, @scheel2022, @scheel2020, and @devezer2021.

## Precision and testability

Research questions and hypotheses should be **precise** (all the components should be clearly defined) and **testable** (they clearly translate into a well-defined, specific study design).

It is difficult to come by precise *and* testable hypotheses in linguistics just because our current knowledge and understanding of language and languages is limited. At best, we can normally come up with vague hypotheses that state whether a difference between two conditions is expected or not and, if we are lucky, the direction of the difference (i.e. "A is greater than B" or vice versa). This state of affairs makes testing hypotheses using statistical methods less straightforward, because of the non-straightforward mapping of (vague) hypotheses to statistical models.

### Spotlight: Falsificationism and falsifiability

**Falsification** is a procedure proposed by philosopher Karl Popper in relation to the "problem of induction". Induction is based on observations. Imagine you observe several swans over a long time period in the United Kingdom and they are all white. You induce that "all swans are white" and expect that to be true because you have never observed a swan that was not white. However, black swans do exist (they are native of Australia and New Zealand). You can see that it doesn't matter how many white swans you observe in the UK, you cannot be certain of the truthfulness of the statement "all swans are white". On the other hand, you only need see one single black swan to know that "all swans are white" is false. In other words, a statement can only ever be shown to be false, never to be true.

So, induction does not necessarily lead us to true statements, but falsification (observing even one case that makes the statement false) surely tells us which statements are false. A falsifiable statement or hypothesis should prevent us from wrongly accepting a false statement (but we can never know if it is true). John Spacey defines statement falsificability in his blog post [Seven examples of falsifiability](https://simplicable.com/new/falsifiability):

> A statement is falsifiable if it can be contradicted by an observation. If such observation is impossible to make with current technology, falsifiability is not achieved.

Some examples of falsifiable hypotheses:

-   "Life only exists on Earth." (it would be falsified by the observation of life somewhere else).
-   "If there is a 1st person exclusive dual, then there is also a 1st person inclusive dual." [\[Universal 1871\]](https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/rara/universals-archive/1876/) (it would be falsified by the observation of languages with a 1st person exclusive dual but without the inclusive alternative).
-   "Infants start uttering full sentences only after their 12th month of life." (it would be falsified by the observation of infants uttering full sentences before their 12th month of life).

The following are some examples of non-falsifiable hypotheses:

-   "Life might exist outside of the Solar system." (if we observe life outside the Solar system or we don't, the statement is still true, because of the *might exist*).
-   "Languages with a 1st person inclusive dual can have a 1st person exclusive dual." (whether we observe a language with both 1st inclusive and exclusive dual or not, the statement is still true, because of the *can have*.)

Falsification has become a tenet of a lost of modern quantitative research and has become what could be regarded as *falsificationism*, but falsification is not the only approach to quantitative research, as you have learned in this chapter: precision and testability are two other equally valid criteria to follow when formulating hypotheses.

If you are interested in the philosophy behind research and statistics (commonly known as "philosophy of science") I recommend the following books (of increasing length and depth): @okasha2016, @dienes2008, @rosenberg2020.
